### Suggesting Enhancements

If submitting an issue/enhancement, please use the issue title to identify what is not working as intended.

  e.g. "Broken link on Cost Allocation page" or "Fix typo on Forecasting page"

Use the body of the issue to add additional context, link relevant information about the issue, or upload images to convey context.

  e.g. "There's a broken URL in this sentence... The URL should be <URL>", or "Please fix the spelling of the word budget on paragraph three..."
  
If you don't know how to resolve the issue, that's okay. Reporting it is a very helpful first step.

Please do not assign issues or apply metadata. The FinOps Foundation team will do these for you.
